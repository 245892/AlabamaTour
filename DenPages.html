		<h1>Alabama Tourism</h1>
		<p>The state of Alabama is home to a range of tourist attractions and things to do for all ages and interests. Several Alabama cities are home to some of the most important Civil Rights monuments, museums, and historic sites. This includes the Civil Rights Institute and Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Montgomery's Civil Rights Monument and National Memorial for Peace and Justice, and Selma's Voting Rights Museum. Alabama is also a culturally rich region. Visitors can see the birthplace and former creative workspace of musician W.C. Handy, admire architecture and design at the Frank Lloyd Wright Rosenbaum House Museum, and view impressive collections at major art museums in both Montgomery and Birmingham.

        Alabama is also full of beautiful natural attractions, especially along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico in Mobile Bay, where tourists will find state parks, nature reserves, and gorgeous sandy beaches. In addition to history and nature, the curious can explore science at the family-friendly McWane Science Center, or behold some of the world's most advanced technology at Huntsville's U.S. Space and Rocket Center. Find the best places to visit in the state with our list of the top tourist attractions in Alabama.

		  	  <div class="card-description">
		  	  	<p>Set along the Gulf of Mexico, Mobile Bay is a scenic area of Alabama's coastline. The area has beaches and historic areas, which attract both locals and tourists year-round. Dauphin Island, located in the Bay, is a barrier island with a small town, which is also called Dauphin Island.

Nearby, the Weeks Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve provides amateur naturalists with the opportunity to explore diverse habitats. Elevated boardwalks and trails can be explored with a guide or independently. Along the southeastern shores of Mobile Bay lie Orange Beach and Gulf Shores.

		  	  	<h2>Frank Lloyd Wright Rosenbaum House Museum</h2>
		  	  </div>
		  	   
		  	  <div class="card-description">
		  	  	<p>Rosenbaum House was built by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1939 for newlyweds Stanley and Mildred Rosenbaum. Located in Florence, the house is the only structure in Alabama designed by Wright. It is constructed of cypress, glass, and brick. The Usonian design features a flat, multi-level roof, and board and batten walls. The house has its original Wright-designed furniture.

		  	  	<h2>U.S. Space and Rocket Center</h2>
		  	  </div>
		  	   
		  	  <div class="card-description">
		  	  	<p>The U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville is an exciting attraction for all ages, providing exhibits, interactive experiences, presentations, and one of the world's largest collections of spacecraft on display. A Smithsonian affiliate, the center's exhibits provide visitors with information on everything from the history of the space race and NASA's growth since then to the International Space Station and beyond. Tourists can experience multimedia presentations at the National Geographic Theater or the Spacedome IMAX, and explore a model of the International Space Station. Visitors also have the chance to see Rocket Park, where 27 rockets and missiles are on display, as well as the gigantic launch vehicles that propel the rockets into space.

                Perhaps the most popular things to do at the Space Center, however, are taking turns in one of the museum's simulators. There are two launch simulators, one of which allows the astronaut-in-training to experience 4 Gs of force, a few seconds of weightlessness, and then a free-fall. The kids' version of this gives young astronauts a less intense version, then "lands" on the surface of the moon. The Hyper Ship simulator uses motion and immersive media to provide a variety of rides, and visitors can also get active on the Mars Climbing Wall. There are also interactive areas for younger kids, where they can explore the surface of Mars and crawl through the space station. The center also offers week-long and single-day camps for kids. </p>
